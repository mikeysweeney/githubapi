My Github API and Visualization for CSU33012

To test the implementation download or pull the resporitory from github

In terminal cd to githubapi
### `cd githubapi`,
then
### `npm install`,
then
### `npm start`,

You should get a popup to localhost and there the project will display. You can then enter a valid github username to display data with the buttons at the bottom of the page

Technologies: React
Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
I used the axios library to pull data from the github api and displayed the visualization with graphs at the bottomof the page
